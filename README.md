# Batch-based Model Registration for Fast 3D Sherd Reconstruction (ICCV2023)
In this work, we aim to develop a portable, high-throughput, and accurate reconstruction system for efficient digitization of fragments excavated in archaeological sites. To realize high-throughput digitization of large numbers of objects, an effective strategy is to perform scanning and reconstruction in batches. We show that our batch-based scanning and reconstruction pipeline can have a high throughput of imaging over 700 sherds per day (8 working hours) with 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.16ùëöùëö.
